## About
JustStreamIt is a website based on the [OCMovies API](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR).

Using the API's database, JustStreamIt shows the best rated movie in its selection and displays four sorted lists:
-  All movies, sorted by rating (from best to worst);
-  The best rated movies between 2000 and 2021;
-  The best rated movies from before the 2000's;
-  The worst rated movies across all years and genres.

You can navigate through these selections using the arrows on each side of the list. To see more details about a movie, just click on its cover.


## Installation & Launch
First, **install the API [OCMovies](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR)**. It doesn't need to be in the same folder as the website.

However, **you will need to launch its server before each use of the website** (step 4 and 7 in its ReadMe).

Then, just **open *index.html*** in the navigator of your choice.
